Changelog: 25 January 2014

-Built slightly upon basic trivia game tutorials from Youtube.
-Learned how to pull my questions from a plaintext file, split them into separate question and rightAnswer variables, and randomize their order.
-Added option to choose which question bank the game pulls from. This allows the user to specify question genre (though right now they're only tests).
